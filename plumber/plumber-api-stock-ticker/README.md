# plumber-api-stock-ticker

The demo aims to demonstrate the `plumber` api, how to publish the API to RStudio Connect, and how to consume the API.

1. Create a simple `plumber` demo script that builds off of the stock ticker example

  - The script should live in the seamonster project
  - It can be as simple as taking a ticker for an input and outputting a day-ahead forecast

2. Create a short set of 2-3 slides that frame the goal of the API and show the code on the left, the use on the right

  - Ideally the slides are HTML written in Markdown to easily live side-by-side with the code

3. Publish the demo to RStudio Connect

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(feather)
library(ggplot2)
```


First use bash to append together several data files into a single file we can read and manipulate:

```{bash}
cd rmarkdown/bash-python-feather || cd .
cat flights1.csv flights2.csv flights3.csv > flights.csv
```

Now use **pandas** to read and filter the data. We'll pass it to R using the high-performance [feather](https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/03/29/feather/) serialization format:

```{python}
import pandas
import feather
import os

try:
  os.chdir("rmarkdown/bash-python-feather")
except:
  print("Already in appropriate directory")

# Read flights data and select flights to O'Hare
flights = pandas.read_csv("flights.csv")
flights = flights[flights['dest'] == "ORD"]

# Select carrier and delay columns and drop rows with missing values
flights = flights[['carrier', 'dep_delay', 'arr_delay']]
flights = flights.dropna()
print flights.head(10)

# Write to feather file for reading from R
feather.write_dataframe(flights, "flights.feather")
```

Now read from *flights.feather* into an R data frame and plot arrival delays by carrier using **ggplot2**:

```{r}
library(feather)
library(ggplot2)

tryCatch({setwd('rmarkdown/bash-python-feather/')},
         error = function(e) {NULL})

# Read from feather and plot
flights <- read_feather("flights.feather")
ggplot(flights, aes(carrier, arr_delay)) + geom_boxplot()
```
